# collections can store multiple pieces of data inside

# Lists - called arrays in other languages

#shopping_list = ["salad", "eggs", "doughnuts", "milk", "salmon"]
#print(shopping_list)
#print(type(shopping_list))
#print(shopping_list[-1])

#shopping_list[2] = "tomato"
#print(shopping_list)

# List methods

# Add something to the end of a list
#shopping_list.append("carrots") # adds to the end
#shopping_list.extend(["water","celery"]) #adds multiple
#print(shopping_list)

#removing iteams from a list
#shopping_list.remove("salad")
#print(shopping_list)

#pop method
# .pop removes the last value of the list when it has nothing past it

# Mixed data type lists - python doesn't mind mixed data

# list slicing
# print(mixture[1:3])
# print(mixture[-2::]) - causes a skip/step every other value

# Tuples - they cannot be changed, immutable

#essentials = ("bread", "eggs", "milk")
#print(essentials)
