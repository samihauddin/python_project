# Label data within a progam and store it. so it can be referenced later.

# PYTHON IS DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE - this means that we do not have to state what type of variable it is.

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3.05
hi = "hello world"

# Type method
print(type(a))

# Variables - can change and be overwritten
