## Libraries and Modules in Python

### What are Libraries?

- Libraries in Python is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later in a program. It makes Python programming simpler and convenient for programmers. 

### What are Modules?

- Modules are a single file of functions, classes, variables etc. That you can bring in and use in another Python file.

### The differences between them?

- The main difference between libraries and modules is that a module is a file that has a python code in it that is used to run code that is specif to the user, while a library is a collection of modules and code snippets that can be used in your programs and projects. 

### Why are they useful?

- **code reusability**: Libraries and modules allow you to reuse exciting code 
- **collaboration**: they allow collaboration among developers
- **efficiency**: many Python libraries are written in low-level languages which can make then faster than writing equivalent code in pure python. 
- **Bug prevention**: Libraries and Modules are typically well-tested by a community of developers, which can help catch and fix bugs. 

### Examples of important base(built-in) libraries and modules. 

- Math Module `import math` provides mathematical functions and constants
- Random Module `import random` used for generating random number
- Datetime Module `import datetime` allows working with dates and times
- time `import time`
- socket `import socket`
