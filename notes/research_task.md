## Research Task

#### Why is Python so popular?

- It is an open source, which means its is freely usable and disputable 
- It is multiplatform e.g Windows, Mac, Linux
- It has a large and active community 
- It has a huge list of supporting libraries 

#### What are some of the different areas Python is used?

Python has multiple industry applications:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data Science 
- Machine Learning 
- Game development 

#### Who is using Python (examples of companies please).

Python is used by a number of popular companies:
- Google
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Amazon
- Uber 

#### Why is Python used in DevOps?

When it comes to DevOps, the main goal is to reduce the time taken in the DevOps life cycle and improve efficiency. Python offers a structural solution in terms of automating the tasks in each of the stages in the DevOps life cycle. 

It is used by the DevOps teams for a number of reasons:
- **Efficient**: Code can be written with best practices, process and patterns.
- **Agile programming**: It can be used for deployment automation and web development, as it is used for scripting in DevOps
- **Adapt changes**: Python in DevOps culture helps make it scalable, adaptable. 
- **Ease things**: Python eases scripting, automation and programming because of its straight forward syntax. 

#### What is a script? And how are they different to Programs?

- Scripts are few lines of code used within a program. These scripts are written to automate some particular tasks within the program.

- Programming languages are a set of code/instructions for the computer that are compiled at runtime. Thus an exe file is created.

#### Why are scripts useful? What is their main purpose?

-  serve as a versatile tool providing a means to simplify, optimize, and expedite various tasks.

- They are valuable for individuals and organizations looking to enhance efficiency, reduce manual labor, and ensure the reliability of their processes.

#### Why use Python for scripting?

- Python is one of the best scripting languages. The vast variety of python libraries allows us to write scripts for the improved development life cycle.

- Python provides the frameworks to write structured and readable automation scripts.

- When it comes to orchestration and infrastructure automation, python is quite useful.
- Python saves time in building utilities thanks to the ease of learning the coding langage.
- Python offers an adaptive feature that results in exploring new tools and technologies without any effort, thanks to its flexibility and adaptability.
